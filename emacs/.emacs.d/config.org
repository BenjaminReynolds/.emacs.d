* Introduction
  
I have been a user of GNU Emacs for most of my development career. In that time I 
have experimented with a number of pre-built emacs configurations most notably
[[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs][spacemacs]] and [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][doom-emacs]].

After a great deal of frustration with this kinds of "distrubtions" of emacs,
I decided to start work on my own configuration file. This document presents that
configuration as literate elisp in an org file.

Much of this configuration is inspired by or based on the configuration of [[https://github.com/rememberYou/.emacs.d][Terencio Agozzino]].
